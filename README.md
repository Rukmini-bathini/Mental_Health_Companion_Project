# Mental_Health_Companion_Project
A machine learning project that predicts the need for mental health treatment.
Contains:
1. Python code for prediction using ML Algorithms.
2. Python code for UI creation for Interactivity(Refer mhc.py file).

ABSTRACT: Mental health is an important issue in the world today. With a large population now working 
from home and staying away from loved ones, the mental health situation has deteriorated. 
As such, it becomes important to know if a requires mental health treatment before they get 
too serious. The project focuses on building a mental health prediction model. We try to get 
an idea of the mental state of your user (in the least intrusive ways). The next step is taking
the answers to certain important questions that are considered significant to analyze their 
mental health state. This project involves building a simple interface. A user answers some 
questions and based on the answers that they provide, we will predict if they require mental 
health treatment or not and display it.

Mental health entails more than the absence of mental illnesses. Mental health issues affect 
the entire population, not just a tiny, isolated portion. Hence, we all need to invest our time, 
and technology toward a healthy mind.
